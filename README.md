# FuseBox

FuseBox is a game inspired by Club Penguin's fuse box minigame. After the game's closure, this game cannot be played anywhere else.

It is written in Java using the Swing toolkit.

## Getting Started

It's easy to get started!

Compile the project with your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans), then run the .jar file generated by your IDE.

Specify your preferred grid size (bigger grid sizes are significantly more difficult), and choose from easy and hard mode, then enjoy!
